/**
 * Particular lateral caches should define their own factory.  It is
 * not necessary to extend this base factory, but it can be useful.
 * <p>
 * The old factory tried to handle all types of laterals.  It was
 * gettting cluttered by ad hoc if statements.  Since the javagroups
 * lateral was jdk1.4 dependent it had to be moved.  As such, the
 * old factory could no longer import it.  This motivated the change.
 * <p>
 * This abstraction layer should keep things cleaner.
