/**
 * Used to repair the remote caches managed by the associated instance of RemoteCacheManager.

 * When there is an error the monitor kicks off. The Failover runner starts looks for a manager with
 * a connection to a remote cache that is not in error. If a manager's connection to a remote cache
 * is found to be in error, the restorer kicks off and tries to reconnect. When it is succesful, the
 * status of the manager changes.
 * <p>
 * When the failover runner finds that the primary is in good shape, it will switch back. Switching
 * back invovles setting the first no wait on the no wait facade.
